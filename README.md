# C++: STL
This is a repository of study notes and programs on C++ that I'll build as I learn the langauge!
I’m still a student learning C++, so I might make mistakes (actually I most likely will) in the content below, so feel free to tell me if there are any issues (it would help a lot! Thanks in advance!!). I know there are a lot of C++ vector teaching sites, but these are the notes that have helped me understand the concepts and digest the information. I hope these notes can help you in some way.
(I apologize for my overuse of exclamation marks, especially if it irritates you. But I’m keeping them there because I like ‘em.:)

#### I really worked on the 01-1 notes & annotation. Go check it out! (Please? *Blink Blink*) I knew you'd go read it!
